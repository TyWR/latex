    \textbf{Re: Application to data engineer position}\\[0.2cm]
    \today, \\[1cm]
    Dear Sir or Madam,

As a highly motivated and meticulous student with strong scientific background
and programming skills, I would like to apply for the data engineer position.
With my Master of Science and Executive Engineering in Applied Mathematics
from the Ecole des Mines de Nancy, one of the top french engineering school,
I am confident I will be a valuable asset to your team. \\[0.5cm]
%
In my current role as a software engineer at the Foundation Campus Biotech
Geneva, I have been given the opportunity to work on a project focused on
neuroscience data visualization. This project has allowed me to drastically
improve my programming skills, time-series data analysis and crafting of
data-pipelines. Through my work, the project has produced a finished
application for neuroscience visualization. \\[0.5cm]
%
These experiences have allowed me to develop strong time-management and
analytical skills, which I see as being very important when seeking to work
in a highly technical environment. But the most important skill that I earned
is my ability to learn new technologies quickly. \\[0.5cm]

I am aware that you will receive a large number of applications for this job,
but I would very much appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities
to you in person. \\[0.5cm]
%
I believe that I have a lot to offer your organization. I am keen to develop
my computer science skills and look forward to discussing my application with
you at an interview. I have enclosed a copy of my resume for your
consideration. I can be contacted at all times on the details provided above.
